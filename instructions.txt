We want to redo the src\components\Projects section from our app. We want to keep all the fancy animations we already built and the design, but we have to change the layout of the section.


### Layout Description 

Section Layout Description:

Background:

grey background for the section (similar our current app use in some components).

Grid Structure:

3 columns by 2 rows (total of 6 content blocks visible).

Each block has equal width and height, spaced evenly with consistent margins/gaps between them.

Content Block Structure:

Top half:

A centered logo (black text ) on a solid white background.

Logos vary in typography and may include symbols (e.g., "T" for Deutsche Telekom, "PwC" logo, etc.).

Bottom half:

Title: White bold text, left-aligned, one line or wrapped to two lines.

Subtitle / Description: Small, grey text, separated by vertical bars (|), acting as metadata tags (e.g., "Corporate | Compliance & Regulatory | Large Law Firm | EMEA").

Typography & Colors:

Logo: Black

Title: Black bold text 

Metadata: dark grey text 

Background of each card: white.

Alignment & Spacing:

Logos are vertically and horizontally centered in their respective top area.

Text content below logo is left-aligned with small padding from card edges.

Metadata is smaller and uses tighter line-height compared to the title.
